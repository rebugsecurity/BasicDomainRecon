# BasicDomainRecon
If you have proper authorization and need to perform active reconnaissance on domains for legitimate security testing purposes, here's an example of how you can perform basic reconnaissance tasks using Python

# Disclaimer
``This code uses the requests library in Python to perform DNS lookup, WHOIS lookup, and port scanning on a target domain. It fetches DNS records, WHOIS information, and checks if specific ports are open on the target domain. Note that port scanning or any other reconnaissance activity should be performed only on systems and domains that you have proper authorization to access, and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Always follow ethical guidelines and obtain proper authorization before performing any security testing activities.``

# Installing the programs requirements:
``sudo pip3 install requests``

# Usage:
``python3 reconn.py`` Change "target_domain" to whatever you'd like and the ports as well.
